  abstract = "The global impact of COVID-19 has been profound, and the public
              health threat it represents is the most serious seen in a
              respiratory virus since the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Here we
              present the results of epidemiological modelling which has
              informed policymaking in the UK and other countries in recent
              weeks. In the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, we assess the
              potential role of a number of public health measures-so-called
              non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)-aimed at reducing contact
              rates in the population and thereby reducing transmission of the
              virus. In the results presented here, we apply a previously
              published microsimulation model to two countries: the UK (Great
              Britain specifically) and the US. We conclude that the
              effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is likely to
              be limited, requiring multiple interventions to be combined to
              have a substantial impact on transmission. Two fundamental
              strategies are possible: (a) mitigation, which focuses on slowing
              but not necessarily stopping epidemic spread-reducing peak
              healthcare demand while protecting those most at risk of severe
              disease from infection, and (b) suppression, which aims to
              reverse epidemic growth, reducing case numbers to low levels and
              maintaining that situation indefinitely. Each policy has major
              challenges. We find that that optimal mitigation policies
              (combining home isolation of suspect cases, home quarantine of
              those living in the same household as suspect cases, and social
              distancing of the elderly and others at most risk of severe
              disease) might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by
              half. However, the resulting mitigated epidemic would still
              likely result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health
              systems (most notably intensive care units) being overwhelmed
              many times over. For countries able to achieve it, this leaves
              suppression as the preferred policy option. We show that in the
              UK and US context, suppression will minimally require a
              combination of social distancing of the entire population, home
              isolation of cases and household quarantine of their family
              members. This may need to be supplemented by school and
              university closures, though it should be recognised that such
              closures may have negative impacts on health systems due to
              increased",
